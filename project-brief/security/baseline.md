# Security Baseline

- Entra ID: disable legacy auth; conditional access; least‑privilege roles
- Managed Identities for all automation services
- Key Vault for secrets; no secrets in Power Automate connections
- App Insights for run logs; alerting on failures and anomalies
- Change control: export/import solution packages; versioned artifacts
- Audit: capture who ran, when, what identities changed
