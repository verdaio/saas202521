# AI Automation Agency — Design & Execution Plan (M365 Onboarding Wedge)

## Goal
Launch a productized service that installs a working new‑hire onboarding automation in 48 hours for Microsoft 365 organizations and converts to a monthly improvement retainer.

## Wedge
**New‑hire onboarding for M365 shops (50–250 staff).** Outcome: reduce time‑to‑productive from ~5 days to ≤1 day; remove 10–20 manual steps per hire.

## Offer Ladder
- **Foot‑In‑The‑Door (FTD):** $500–$800, 48 hours, 1 workflow + Teams onboarding space + SharePoint queue + runbook + rollback.
- **Core Retainer:** $1.5k–$3k/mo, 2–4 workflows, monitoring, monthly improvements, on‑call break/fix.
- **Performance Bonus (optional):** $500–$2k/mo tied to KPI deltas (time‑to‑productive, error rate, SLA).

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- 50–250 employees, actively hiring 5–20/month
- Microsoft 365 with Entra ID, SharePoint, Teams; HRIS: BambooHR/Rippling/Paylocity/HiBob
- Complaints: slow onboarding, license/access mistakes, scattered checklists, no metrics

## Core KPIs
- Time‑to‑productive (days → hours)
- Manual steps eliminated per hire
- Access error rate per hire
- First‑day task completion rate
- Support tickets related to onboarding

Day 9–12: deliver first two retainer workflows  
Day 13: publish 1‑page case study (metric + GIF)
