## Subject
48‑hour new‑hire pack for {Company}

## Email #1
{Name}, you’re hiring {X} roles. Your M365 stack can auto‑create accounts, licenses, Teams onboarding spaces, and manager checklists. I recorded a 58‑sec walkthrough of your exact flow and a 48‑hour pilot that removes ~3 hours per hire. If it doesn’t stick, I’ll remove it and refund.

Want me to install it in your sandbox tomorrow?

## Follow‑up #1 (Day 2)
Recorded a 22‑sec GIF showing your Team template with checklist and permissions. This replaces 10–15 manual steps. Ready to try it in a sandbox?

## Follow‑up #2 (Day 5)
Quick ROI: 12 hires/month × 3 hrs × $45/hr = **$1,620/mo**. Your cost for install is $500. Want the pilot?

## Follow‑up #3 (Day 10)
Case study: time‑to‑productive dropped from 5 days to 1 at {Client}. GIF + numbers here: {link}. Two slots this week.
