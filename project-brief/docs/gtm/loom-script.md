# 60‑Second Loom Script (Audit → Deal)

Hi {Name}, I looked at your careers page and saw {X} open roles. With your Microsoft 365 stack, you can auto‑create new‑hire accounts, assign licenses, spin up a Teams onboarding space, and push a day‑1 checklist to managers.

I mocked your flow: **{HRIS} request → Entra ID user + license → Teams Onboarding space → SharePoint checklist.** This removes about **3 hours per hire** and cuts day‑1 access mistakes to near zero.

If you want, I can install a **48‑hour pilot** in a sandbox so you can test it without touching production. Here are the four screens and where the savings come from. Foot‑in‑the‑door is **$500 flat**; if it doesn’t stick in 14 days, I’ll remove it and refund.

Want me to install it tomorrow?
