# SOP — QA (Day 2 Morning)

1. Test with two sample hires (employee + contractor).
2. Validate: account creation, license assignment, group memberships, Teams space creation, checklist assignment.
3. Edge cases: missing manager, license pool empty, duplicate email, name collision.
4. Verify logs and alerts; simulate failure paths and confirm rollback works.
